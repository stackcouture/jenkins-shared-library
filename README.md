# Jenkins Shared Library - `vars` Directory

This directory contains reusable Groovy scripts (global variables) for Jenkins pipelines. Each script provides a callable function that can be used directly in your `Jenkinsfile`. These scripts cover **CI/CD tasks**, including Docker image management, Git operations, security scanning, deployment, and notifications.
